To analyze this data directly from Yahoo finance, I used an Anaconda3 vitual environment. In there, I installed specific libraries: yfinance, matplotlib, pandas and jupyter. This last one isn't required but necessary to test the code in a IDE (I used VScode) and check if the code is working properly before adding it to the Power BI environment. 
In case you want to use my code to test and try yourself, feel free to do so. However, make sure you understand how to create and configure a virtual environment containing the libraries aforementioned. Otherwise, this code is completely useless and will not work in your Power BI or any other graphics creation app you might use.
