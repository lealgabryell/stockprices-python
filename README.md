To analyze this data directly from Yahoo finance, I used an Anaconda3 vitual environment. In there, I installed specific libraries: yfinance, matplotlib, pandas and jupyter. This last one isn't required but necessary to test the code in a IDE (I used VScode) and check if the code is working properly before adding it to the Power BI environment.
